I finished the stuff that we did in the last meeting:
- tidied up the GUI interface (resized and aligned everything)
-Created the legend at the bottom
Note: in not sure how we can incorporate the color changing schema in the connected mode as the changes are made instantly to the server
- Named all the values that we have put on the form
Needed:
i dont have the list of 9 variables to complete the form, if Lucy or Fred can complete the last 2-3 that would be great
